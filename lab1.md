### Part 1: Installing Visual Studio Code
(If you use a different integrated development environment similar to Visual Studio code or are unable to install it, you can skip this step and move on to the next Part)

To install Visual Studio Code you want to go to there [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download whatever operating system your computer is running on (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc) and install Visual Studio Code.
